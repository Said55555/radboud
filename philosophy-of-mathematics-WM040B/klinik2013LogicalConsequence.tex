\title{On Logical Consequence}
\author{Markus Klinik (s4220315)}
\maketitle

This document is a brief summary of two papers on logical consequence: Tarski's
``On The Concept of Following Logically'' and Shapiro's ``Logical Consequence,
Proof Theory and Model Theory''.

The summary of the original texts is given in normal font.  My questions and
comments are set in italics.

\section{Tarksi}

Making precise the notion of \emph{following logically} was made in the past in
an arbitrary manner.

\subsection{The syntactical approach}

Deductive system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Start from axioms
    \item Apply inference rules
    \item Accept conclusion as proven
\end{itemize}

\emph{Which formal system is he referring to?  Hilbert?}

Logicians suppose that these few rules of inference completely capture the
notion of following.  Their point is justified by sucessfully proving lots of
old theorems.

\subsection{Criticism of the syntactic approach}

Counterexample: In the deductive system, it is not the
case that from the infinite set of axioms $\{ n\text{ has property }P\ |\ n \in
\mathbb{N} \}$ the sentence ``Every number has property $P$'' follows.  But this
is indubitable the case from the viewpoint of everyday intuition.  Systems
exhibiting this shortcoming are called $\omega$-incomplete.

We can try to fix the situation by adding the principle described above as a
rule in the system.  Only now, this rule has infinitely many premises, which
would make our proof trees infinitary.  How can one prove infinitely many
premises?

We need some kind of meta-argument: all these sentences are provable.  Note the
difference between ``is provable'' and ``has been proven''.  Now, ``is provable
in the system'' is a sentence in metatheory.  Thus, our deductive system must be
rich enough to talk about itself.  This is easy.  Any system where arithmetic is
possible can talk about itself.  At first sight, enriching our system with
meta-arguments seems to sufficiently capture what was missing.

Enter GÃ¶del: If the system is rich enough, we can always construct sentences
that follow in the everyday sense, but cannot be proven in the system.

Therefore, we need a different conceptual apparatus than deductive systems.
Nota bene: the $\omega$-incomplete system is still important, because it works
well for what it does.

\subsection{The semantic approach}

\emph{In the following, $\Gamma$ is always a set of sentences, and $\varphi$ a
sentence.}

First try, by Carnap: $\varphi$ is a consequence of $\Gamma$ iff $\Gamma$
together with $\neg\varphi$ leads to a contradiction.  This approach however is
too narrow, because it requires the concepts of contradiction and negation in
the language.

Let us first think about which intuitive properties the notion of consequence
should have.  Mainly two things:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Assume $\varphi$ follows from $\Gamma$ intuitively.  It cannot be the
  case that every sentence in $\Gamma$ is true but $\varphi$ is false.

  \item Following cannot depend on our knowledge of the external world.  In
  particular, it cannot depend on the objects we are speaking of.
\end{enumerate}
These conditions are necessary but not sufficient:  The language would be
required to have a constant symbol for every object.  \emph{I don't understand
why that is.}

Introduce the notion of model:  Let $\Gamma$ be a theory. Replace all constant
symbols with variables, call this $\Gamma'$.  A \emph{model} of $\Gamma$ is a
sequence of objects satisfying every sentential function in $\Gamma'$.

Now we can formulate the famous definition: A sentence $\varphi$ follows
logically from a theory $\Gamma$ iff every model of $\Gamma$ is also a model of
$\varphi$.

Some Notes: This definition fulfils the condition from above.  The definition is
independent of the language under consideration.  If the language has negation,
and defining contradictory as having no model, this definition is equivalent to
the one by Carnap.

\subsection{An open question}

The definition relies on the distinction between logical and non-logical
symbols.  But where to draw the line?  At least implication and quantifier must
be logical for this to work, but it would make sense to regard all symbols as
logical.  In this case, Tarski's consequence would be equivalent to material
consequence.  \emph{How so? What does he mean by \emph{all symbols}? Certainly
not relations and functions?}
