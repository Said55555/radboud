- line numbers in parser error messages seem to be off-by-one
- source locations in parser need to be +1 for both line and column (editors start counting at 1)
- use <?> to generate better error messages
-- source locations of pNegatedExpression are not correct. Need to use source location of pSymbol "-" in pBaseExpr
